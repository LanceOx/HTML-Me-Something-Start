               <h3 id="miniHeader"><em>Starting the trip off WRONG!!!</em> </h3><img src="images.js/images/picard-facepalm2.jpg" alt="smh"> 
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">To give you some back story on how the trip started.. My brother and I both decided we wanted to share a rental car.
                  THE NIGHT BEFORE we left we were scheduled to pick up the rental. Upon getting to the rental pick up - it took forever just to find the entrance.
                  At this point I'm already getting flustered. I finally just get out and head to the front door while my brother finds a parking spot. I was in there
                  less than 10 minutes, the original cashier was getting me set up since I had a pre-registered for the rental. Once I thought we were finalizing the deal 
                  he asked for my form of payment, which I proceeded to give my debit card. He swiped it no problem and only after that it went through did he realize he 
                  made a mistake and needed my credit card. The assistat manager was called over, where he was able to issue the refund to my card (I still had to wait a week 
                  for the money even though I am about to start my trip). So, now that we had the refund taken care of, the manager proceeds to tell me they need a major credit card.
                  I was under the impression since I had pre-registered that it was already taken care of, but anyways I hand him my new card and yet again, he proceeds to tell
                  me that it is not a major credit card. So, long story short, I set up my rental through Priceline and they hooked me up with Alamo. Since I went through Priceline 
                  and got one of their &apos;Digital Coupons&apos;, in their fine print there is no form of a refund even if the customer does not pick up the car. So to start my trip off,
                  I was out of close to &yen;400 just from the reservation of the rental on top of waiting on a refund that did not come until after the trip... I left a nasty review.

               <h3 id="miniHeader">Missouri</h3>
               <p id="smallParagraph">
                  The drive through Missouri was rather uneventful. We left about 5 in the morning so traffic was pretty limited for the most part.
                  I was the first behind the wheel and drove a little over 3 hours before I had to switch. After that it was staring out the window
                  because my brother pretty much drove the rest of the way there.

               <h4 id="miniHeader">Kansas</h4>
               <p id="smallParagraph">
                  I can easily say that Kansas was the most boring state I have ever driven through. Once we made it out of Kansas City, which was 
                  ridiculous dealing with those city roads, it turned into nothing but flat uncolorful fields. There were the occasional cows and farm 
                  equipment, but other than that there was nothing to look at on our long drive down the highway.

               <h5 id="miniHeader">Colorado</h5>
               <p id="smallParagraph">
                  Finally, after roughly 12 hours of being on the road, we made it to Colorado. I originally wanted to try In-N-Out Burger, but it was well
                  out of the way and we were ready to make it to our Air BnB by then so we settled for Five Guys and made it to our destination.

               <li>At our Air Bnb, we had and incredible view of Pikes Peak, a hot tub, billiards, and lots of access to local wildlife.<br>There were deer all over and our neighbors had cows and horses next door.</li><br>
               <li>Our first major site seeing we did, was heading to the Garden of the Gods. The ride there we went from a bright sunny day to dense fog at the snap of a finger once we made it in the ravine of the mountian.
                  <br>Once we made it to the Garden of the Gods we drove through a windy road that took us to a place where there was the <b><em>Balanced Rock</em></b> was located along with a cool trail to take.</li><br>
               <li>We went to <em>Downtown, Manitou Springs</em> and that had a bunch of cool little shops along with a cafe we found. I forgot my wallet so unfortunately I was limtited to what I could do that whole time...</li><br>
               <li>Our last major event we did was take a &quot;spooky tour&quot; in the <em>Cave of the Winds</em>. The tour wasnt that spooky, it was more of us walking the caves in the dark. Overall there was a cool view where we parked, 
                  going throug the tour was an experience and I ended up with a cool hoodie.</li>
